1. Create table with following columns: id, name (of Company), country, city, team_members, investment. Id values should be assigned automatically, name values should be unique.

Feel free to use these values:

| id | name      | country | city      | team_members | investment |
+----+-----------+---------+-----------+--------------+------------+
|  1 | Cogniance | UA      | Kyiv      |          567 |      90000 |
|  2 | Microsoft | USA     | Redmond   |      1000000 |    7000000 |
|  3 | Raduga    | UA      | Ternopil  |            3 |   75000000 |

|  5 | Google    | USA     | MV        |          100 |       9000 |
|  7 | Kenguru   | AT      | Canberra  |          100 |      20000 |

2. Send MySQL request to receive all records sorted by name, in descending order. 

3. Change investments values to "200" for companies in which 50<team_members<100.

4. Send MySQL request to receive list of all countries from the table (without duplicating it).

5. Send MySQL request to sum team memers of companies, which names begin with "M".
